# 🏡 EstateFlow — Real Estate CRM | Personal MERN Project for Placement

**EstateFlow** is a Real Estate Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that I built to practice and demonstrate my full-stack development skills. It is designed to help real estate agents organize their workflow, manage client details, and streamline communication — all from a clean, responsive interface.

This project was created as part of my placement preparation and showcases my ability to build complete web applications using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 🔹 **Modern UI** – Built with React for a smooth and responsive experience  
- 🔹 **Backend API** – Node.js and Express handle authentication and data routes  
- 🔹 **MongoDB Integration** – Stores all agent, property, and lead data securely  
- 🔹 **Authentication System** – Includes protected routes and role-based access  
- 🔹 **Fully Responsive** – Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

To run the project locally on your machine:

```

Now, return to the root directory and start the full-stack server:

```bash

The backend and frontend will start together using `concurrently`.
